              <p><strong>Welcome to Traditional Games for Every Child (TGEC)!</strong></p>
              <p>At TGEC, we believe that play is more than just funâ€”it's a bridge to culture, learning, and connection. Our mission is to revive and share the rich tradition of Filipino games, bringing them to children, families, and communities around the world. By promoting these classic, time-honored games, we aim to foster physical activity, teamwork, creativity, and a deeper understanding of cultural heritage.</p>

              <h3>Why Traditional Games?</h3>
              <p>In today's digital age, children are often more connected to screens than to the outdoors or to each other. Traditional Filipino games offer a unique opportunity to unplug, get active, and bond with others in a meaningful way. These games not only provide hours of entertainment but also teach important values such as cooperation, sportsmanship, and respect for others.</p>

              <h3>Our Goal</h3>
              <p>Our goal at TGEC is simple: to make traditional Filipino games accessible and enjoyable for children everywhere. Whether you're a parent, teacher, or community leader, we provide clear instructions, fun ideas, and helpful tips to integrate these games into everyday life. We hope to spark a sense of nostalgia for those who grew up playing these games and introduce them to new generations.</p>

              <h3>What We Offer</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Game Instructions:</strong> Detailed, easy-to-follow steps for a variety of traditional Filipino games.</li>

                  <li><strong>Fun for All Ages:</strong> While focused on children, our games can be enjoyed by people of all ages, creating opportunities for intergenerational play.</li>
              </ul>
